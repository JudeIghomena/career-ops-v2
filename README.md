# Career Wizard

**by Janna AI Research Labs — an iRaven Group company**

Career Wizard is an AI-powered job search command center that turns any job URL into a full evaluation, tailored CV, and tracked application — all from a single tool.

> **This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career Wizard is a filter — it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable. Always review before submitting.

## What It Does

- **Evaluates job offers** with a structured scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored CVs** — ATS-optimized, customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Tracks everything** in a single pipeline with status management and follow-up reminders
- **GUI Dashboard** — full browser-based interface via Career Wizard Web
